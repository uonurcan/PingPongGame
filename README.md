This game, which we developed as a school project, is for the android platform. 
It was a teamwork. I was one of two guys responsible for coding. Other team members worked on the GUI and database side.

You can log in the game or play as a guest.
Guests can only play a simple practice match.
Registered user can play single or multiplayer. There is a choice of difficulty level for single player. A registered user earns points for winning a match and loses points for losing a match. User can get a new racket or table with the points earned. Better racket means better shot. Racket, table and score information are stored in the database. If the registered user exits the ongoing game, s/he loses points.
Unity game engine and mysql database were used. Multiplayer connection is via wifi.
